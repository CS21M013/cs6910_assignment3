# Vanilla Seq2Seq Model
## This is the vanilla transliteration model developed using RNNs (RNN, LSTM and GRU)
The folder contains the follwing files:  
1. CS6910_vanilla_seq2seq.ipynb - The ipynb file containing the entire code for the experimentation. It can be executed entirely on its own.  
2. best_train.py - The python file that is used for the training and evaluation of the best model.
3. inference.py - The python file used for inferencing the model
4. model.py - The python file containg the entire model template using encoder and decoder architecture
5. predict.py - The python file that will be used to get the predictions of the best model on the test data
6. train_Hyperprameter_Tuning.py - The python file is for performing the sweeps or the hyperparameter tuning of the model for some parameters
7. util.py This python file contains some functions that can be used as utilitary functions for the training and the model development and testing of the model.
