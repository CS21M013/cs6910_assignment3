# Fine-Tuning a GPT2 model for lyrics generation
Authors: Anurag Mahendra Shukla (CS21M007) and Chandra Churh Chatterjee (CS21M013).

## File Descriptions:

### GPT2_Training.ipynb
Jupyter notebook containing code for fine-tuning the GPT2 model.

### Generation_GPT2.ipynb
Jupyter notebook containing code for generating lyrics using the fine-tuned GPT2 model.


## Note: 

GPT2_Training.ipynb can only be run on Google Colab Pro due to the memory consumed while fine-tuning GPT2 model. Running it on Google Colab (Free version) will raise memory error.



Because training requires a Google Colab Pro or a powerful GPU(If running on the local machine), we have already trained the model and saved it on Drive.

Please download the trained model from:

https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1KsmwFtrWH-lmXAe3sQCMnWYRYNmmRF28

and upload it in your drive before running Generation_GPT2.ipynb
